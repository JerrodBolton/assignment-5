print("Are you ready to start?") # Prompting the user to get ready
print("----------------------------------")
print("Let's begin our Python journey")
print("We will be going over the `print` function and variables") # Explanation of print function and variables
print("----------------------------------")
print("The print function is used to display output to the console showing what you typed in the parentheses.")
print("print( For Example,  'Hello, World!') will display Hello, World! on the console.") # Example of print function
