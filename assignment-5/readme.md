# Assignment 5: Python Collections  

## Overview  
In this assignment, we will explore Python's four primary collection types: **Lists**, **Dictionaries**, **Tuples**, and **Sets**. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to write programs that effectively utilize these data structures, including indexing, manipulation, and other common operations. This assignment aims to provide a clear understanding of how to use these data structures in Python.  

## Guidelines  
Enhance your interactive function assignment application by incorporating one or more of the following data structures to manage inventory:  

- **List**  
- **Tuple**  
- **Set**  
- **Dictionary**  

### Expectations  
1. Upgrade your existing Python interactive function assignment application, or create a new program from scratch.  
2. Integrate one or more of the new data structures in a meaningful way that aligns with your program's purpose.  
3. Ensure your application performs a useful task, such as managing an inventory system, rather than simply demonstrating data structures.  
4. Focus on creating a great user experience (UX).  
5. Include detailed comments throughout your code to explain its functionality.  

## Deliverables / Submission  
- Your `.py` code file(s).  
- A link to a YouTube video or screenshots demonstrating your program in action, showcasing the inventory system.  
- **Do not zip your submission!**  

## Example Use Case  
Consider creating an inventory system where:  
- **Lists** store a collection of items.  
- **Dictionaries** map item names to their quantities.  
- **Tuples** represent immutable data like item categories.  
- **Sets** ensure unique item names.  

## Tips  
- Test your program thoroughly to ensure it handles edge cases.  
- Use meaningful variable names and maintain clean, readable code.  
- Focus on creating a user-friendly interface for your application.  

Good luck, and happy coding!
